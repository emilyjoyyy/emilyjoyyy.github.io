    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I'm Emily, 22 years old, and studying Digital Media at Leuphana University in Germany.
    </p>

    <p>I'm at Birkbeck for the full academic year as a year abroad through Erasmus, so in my final term here.
    </p>

    <p>At my German uni, I had a seminar on programming with python, and learned a little bit of html for that as well, but no where near "fluent" in any of it.
